# Apollo Habit Tracker
This is a habit tracking app I'm building for Apollo content on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/samjulien), [Thinkster](http://thinkster.io), and [egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/sam-julien). 

The theme is inspired by the work of people like [Amy Hoy & Alex Hillman](https://stackingthebricks.com/), [James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear)'s [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), and [BJ Fogg](https://twitter.com/bjfogg)'s [Tiny Habits](https://www.tinyhabits.com/book).

To run the server:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

To run the client:

```bash
cd habitrack
npm start
```

This is not even remotely a production ready setup, but have fun!
